[Construction guide](universal-vial-construction-guide-luer-connectors-only.md)

#### Overview

Option 1: \[Not Recommended] Can be used with needles like old caps, however this opens you up to preventable overflows as the old caps did

Option 2: \[Recommended] Can be easily constructed with luer locks&#x20;

#### Advantages

1. Airtight seal to vial
2. \[[Emergency efflux](../../guides/emergency-efflux.md) enabled] - prevent vial overflows
3. Reusable without swapping in new needles
4. Easy assembly with few additional parts&#x20;
5. Can do needles if needed

#### Assembly

#### Overview

Use a honeycomb pattern for the ports to cram more ports onto the cap.

#### Advantages

1. Airtight seal to vial
2. \[[Emergency efflux](../../guides/emergency-efflux.md) enabled] - prevent vial overflows
3. Reusable without swapping in new needles
4. Can hook up more tubes to the cap because nylon tubes are thinner

#### Assembly

See construction protocol [here](5-and-7-port-nylon-tubing-caps-construction-protocol.md).

### Old Needle-Only

GitHub [link](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware/tree/master/Smart%20Sleeve/vial_cap/old_needle_only)

#### Overview

This is the cap that is currently given by default from FynchBio as of 25/01/15.

Requires needles, so cannot have a full seal on the vial. Therefore, should be used with caution because of overflow risk.

#### Assembly

Must be assembled with needles at correct heights before each run.
