#### Overview

Option 1: \[Recommended] Can be easily constructed with luer locks

Option 2: \[Not Recommended] Can be used with needles like old caps, however this opens you up to preventable overflows as the old caps did

#### Advantages

1. \[[Emergency efflux](../../guides/emergency-efflux.md) enabled] - prevent vial overflows via air tight seal to vial
2. Reusable connectors (no need to use needles) - connect tubing directly to luer lock on cap
3. Easy assembly with few additional parts&#x20;
4. Ports work with old needle setup if needed

### 5 and 7 Port \[Nylon Tube Only]

#### Overview

Use a honeycomb pattern for the ports to cram more ports onto the cap.

#### Advantages

1. \[[Emergency efflux](../../guides/emergency-efflux.md) enabled] - prevent vial overflows via air tight seal to vial
2. Reusable connectors (no need to use needles) - connect tubing directly to luer lock on cap
3. Up to 5 or 7 ports per cap (plus sampling port) - other caps only have 4 ports
4. Allows color coding of cap tubing to aid correct setup (see image above)

### \[Old] Needle-Only

GitHub [link](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware/tree/master/Smart%20Sleeve/vial_cap/old_needle_only)

#### Overview

This is the cap that is currently given by default from FynchBio as of 25/01/15.

Requires needles, so cannot have a full seal on the vial. Therefore, should be used with caution because of overflow risk.

#### Assembly

Must be assembled with needles at correct heights before each run.
