# Upgrade Base eVOLVER Hardware

## Vial Cap Upgrades

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 25/01/15, FynchBio gives the cap that only accommodates needles. This cap does not have a tight seal on the vial and thus does not enable emergency efflux.
{% endhint %}

### Benefits / Options

1. Better seal to vial - enables emergency efflux away from vial should too much be pumped in
2. More ports
3. Reusable connectors - can use luer connectors to connect to eVOLVER tubing

See [here](../hardware/vial-caps/) for more information and construction protocols.

## Stronger Stirring

More stirring leads to better aeration and thus better growth in many cases. Try this stir bar for more vigorous stirring: [Length 20 mm, Diameter 3 mm (# SBM-2003-MIC)](https://www.stirbars.com/list.php?category=Stir%20Bars\&subCat=Micro%20PTFE\&sessionID=eel7i7mvvdo1r965d2dp0e6le0).

Try different stir speeds to see if you can get stable and intense stirring.
