# Upgrade Base eVOLVER Hardware

## \[Strongly Recommended] Better 3D Printed Vial Holder

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning: you will need to recalibrate both OD and temperature after doing this.
{% endhint %}

#### Info

You can tell if you have this part because there are triangle-shapes around the screws holding the Smart Sleeve together. If your eVOLVER is stock from Fynch, then you do not have the upgraded part (as of April 2024).&#x20;

#### Benefits

* More consistent OD calibration
  * Because of variation in depth of photodiode and OD LED. See [here](https://www.evolver.bio/t/how-deeply-the-photodiode-and-ir-led-are-pushed-in-to-the-vial-greatly-affects-od-readings/360)
  * Otherwise you will have vials with poor calibrations
* More resistant to overflow
  * On the old 3D printed part (v5.1.1 and below), overflows could easily short the heating resistors
  * The latest version has cutaways to prevent this

#### Guide

1. Print out your vial holder by downloading the latest version [here](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware/tree/master/Smart%20Sleeve/tube-holder)
2. Use [this](building-a-smart-sleeve.md) guide to help you rebuild your Smart Sleeve with the new vial holder
3. [Recalibrate](../getting-started/calibrations/) temperature and OD

## Stronger Stirring

More stirring leads to better aeration and thus better growth in many cases. Try this stir bar for more vigorous stirring: [Length 20 mm, Diameter 3 mm (# SBM-2003-MIC)](https://www.stirbars.com/list.php?category=Stir%20Bars\&subCat=Micro%20PTFE\&sessionID=eel7i7mvvdo1r965d2dp0e6le0).

Try different stir speeds to see if you can get stable and intense stirring.
