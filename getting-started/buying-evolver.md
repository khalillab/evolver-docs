## Buying

If you wish to purchase an eVOLVER, email account@fynchbio.com for a quote.

## Connecting to eVOLVER

Currently eVOLVER requires a dedicated computer connected to it to run experiments. We recommend getting a Mac, which are easier to use and more reliable.

The computer needed for running experiments does not have to be new or powerful.

## Upgrades

Consider implementing these [upgrades](../guides/upgrade-base-evolver-hardware.md) to the Fynch Bio eVOLVER.

## Variants

* [min-eVOLVER](../extensions/min-evolver/)
* [Custom experiments](../extensions/custom-experiments/)
* [Custom fluidics](../extensions/custom-fluidics/)
* [Adding a new experimental parameter](../extensions/adding-a-new-experimental-parameter/)
