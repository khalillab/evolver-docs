# Part Sourcing

{% hint style="info" %}
Check the upgrades guide [here](../upgrade-base-evolver-hardware.md).
{% endhint %}

## Guidelines

1. Use the below Google Sheet to source parts for each of the eVOLVER subsystems (click on the tabs for different parts of the eVOLVER)&#x20;
2. Parts may not be available due to backorder, discontinuation, or regional differences
3. If you are able to find an alternative vendor for a part, please post to the forum so it can be added to the spreadsheet
4. Should you not be able to order a part, post to the forum

## eVOLVER Specific Parts

Many eVOLVER parts must be 3D printed or are custom PCBs made to control eVOLVER hardware. For these, please see the [hardware GitHub](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware) for CAD files and electronics parts lists for eVOLVER PCBs.

### Vial Caps

Choose and 3D print vial caps for your application [here](../hardware/vial-caps/). For most applications choose the "universal" cap.

### Other "Consumables"

See Consumables tab in spreadsheet above.

Recommended to buy several vial racks as well for ease of handling vials.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that the eVOLVER Consumables form post calls for 5/32" barbed connectors and 1/8" tubing. This is no longer recommended; refer to the "Fluidics tab" on the google sheet above and [media bottle and splitter guide.](../guides/making-media-bottles-and-splitters.md#overview)
