# Part Sourcing

## Guidelines

1. Use the below Google Sheet to source parts for each of the eVOLVER subsystems (click on the tabs for different parts of the eVOLVER)&#x20;
2. Parts may not be available due to backorder, discontinuation, or regional differences
3. If you are able to find an alternative vendor for a part, please post to the forum so it can be added to the spreadsheet
4. Should you not be able to order a part, post to the forum

## eVOLVER Specific Parts

Many eVOLVER parts must be 3D printed or are custom PCBs made to control eVOLVER hardware. For these, please see the [hardware GitHub](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware) for CAD files and electronics parts lists for eVOLVER PCBs.

### Vial Caps

{% hint style="info" %}
3D printed nylon caps are currently preferred for their defined influx angles and ease of setting efflux height.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

[Nylon Caps](https://www.evolver.bio/t/where-can-i-order-additional-nylon-caps/81) should be 3D printed from the [hardware GitHub](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware) or ordered from [Fynch Bio](https://www.fynchbio.com/accessories)

* Once nylon caps arrive, clean excess nylon powder out of the tubes with a drill bit or small pipe cleaner

Note that the eVOLVER Consumables form post calls for 5/32" barbed connectors and 1/8" tubing. This is no longer recommended; refer to the "Fluidics tab" on the google sheet above and [media bottle and splitter guide.](../guides/making-media-bottles-and-splitters.md#overview)
