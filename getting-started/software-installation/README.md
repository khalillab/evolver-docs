# Software Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
It is helpful to have a dedicated eVOLVER computer (not a personal computer) as eVOLVER experiments take multiple days. We recommend a Mac for their high reliability and native Python, however users have reported Windows works as well.

eVOLVER software does not take very much computational power or memory so an older computer should be fine.

Search on the [forum ](https://www.evolver.bio/c/software/8)if you have issues with installation.
