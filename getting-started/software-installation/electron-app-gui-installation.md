{% hint style="info" %}
Selection of either .deb or .AppImage is largely based on personal preference and computer environment, each presenting slight pros and cons. If you are unfamiliar with installing Linux packaged software, use this link to learn more about what is applicable to you. Briefly, .deb files are natively designed for Ubuntu and will compile the entire application, along with necessary dependecies, onto the local machine. An AppImage file contains everything necessary to run the program, requiring you to execute the file when you want to run program.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

2\. If downloading `evolver-electron-X.X.X.deb,` open your `Downloads` directory and right-click `evolver-electron-X.X.X.deb` to open the file with `Software Install` .&#x20;
