# Calibrations

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before beginning calibrations all [Software Installation](../software-installation/) and [Network Configuration](../configuring-computer-and-networking/) should be complete.

## About

In order to appropriately interpret data from and actuate physical elements connected to the eVOLVER framework, a relationship must be established between the electrical signals generated by attached sensors and the physical phenomenon they are measuring. This is done by manually measuring values on a controlled set of data via some gold-standard assay or measurement device and comparing these data to the eVOLVER generated data. By doing this across a range of different values, a function can be fit to this relationship to allow eVOLVER to interpret data accurately.

For more information see [here](../../software/dpu/calibration.md).

## Procedure

Calibrations should proceed in the following order:

1. [Temperature Calibration](temperature-calibration.md)
2. [Optical Density Calibration](optical-density-calibration.md)
3. [Pump Calibration](pump-calibration.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the GUI fails to calibrate you can try to use [calibrate.py](manual-calibration-calibrate.py.md) manually.
