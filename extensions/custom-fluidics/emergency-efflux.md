# Emergency Efflux

## Overview

Long have we been plagued by vial overflows. Certainly, many were our fault when we pumped too much in during setup or made unscrupulous changes to code. However, not always! And the cost was always too high for the magnitude of the mistake. Testing vials, rebuilding, and recalibration took weeks of our time.

No longer! We can seal our vials, so that even if we make a mistake and pump too much, it will flow out through an emergency tube into a secondary receptacle.

## Requirements

1. Emergency efflux enabled [vial cap](../../hardware/smart-sleeve/vial-caps/)
2. O-ring
3. Luer caps for unused vial cap ports
4. Emergency efflux tube
5. Secondary receptacle to drape efflux tubes into
