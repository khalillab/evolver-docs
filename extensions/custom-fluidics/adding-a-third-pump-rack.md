## Protocol

### Machine 40-20 Aluminum Tubing

Do for both of the aluminum rails. Diagram can be found [here](https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO/hardware/blob/master/Fluidics%20Box/Pump%20Mounts/Pump\_Expansion\_V2/40x20\_aluminum\_rail.PDF).

1. Cut to final length 5.7 inches (144.78mm)
2. If necessary, drill out the hole on each side so that your M6 x 1mm tap can work
3. Tap each side with M6 x 1mm tap

### Assembly

1. Unscrew 4 screws from top of original pump mount
2. Remove 20-20 aluminum tube
3. Replace with 40-20 tube. Screw in
4. Add 3D printed extenders
5. Screw in 3D printed extenders
6. Slot pump rack in
7. Plug in ribbon cables
