# \[v1.1] ePACE with min-eVOLVER

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page is for version 1.1 min-eVOLVERs ONLY! It does not apply if you have a sheet metal case
{% endhint %}

## Overview

This page only details differences from the general min-eVOLVER experimental [protocol](../starting-an-experiment.md). You are also expected to have an understanding of PACE and how it is normally run before doing ePACE.

## Experimental Overview

#### Problem: PACE host cells overgrow

* In previous PACE experiments, host cells would increase growth rate as the experiment wore on
* This caused problems with phage replication in the lagoon and the selection plasmid breaking
* Solution: controlling host cell density in cell reservoirs

#### Implementing Controlled Host Cell Density in Reservoirs

* We control cell density in eVOLVER by running a turbidostat, which checks cell density and dilutes the culture if it is over a threshold.
* In PACE we remove volume from the cell reservoir and transfer it to the lagoon
  * This changes our turbidostat's volume
  * The amount we dilute will therefore be incorrect (adding 5mL of media to 30mL decreases OD less than adding 5mL of media to 20mL)
  * We rely on host cells to get to a threshold cell density before we dilute
  * They may not reach this threshold before we remove more volume
  * This causes a feedback loop of little volume being added and more being taken out
  * Therefore our turbidostat will get lower and lower volume and eventually break
* Solution: put in the amount of volume we take out of the cell reservoir

#### Chemostat and Turbidostat on the Same Vial&#x20;

* We implement a "hybrid" function
* The "hybrid" function uses both a turbidostat and a chemostat on the host cell reservoir
* Turbidostat for keeping the cells from overgrowing
* Chemostat for keeping volume constant

## Vial Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
Levels of liquid in the vials are set by the height of the efflux needle.
{% endhint %}

Needles used were all 16ga

Reservoir volume = 30 mL

* Efflux needle = 3" needle in the tallest vial cap port
* Media in = 2" needle in the shortest port
* Vial to Vial = 3" needle in the _second_ tallest port

Lagoon volume = 10 mL

* Efflux needle = 4" needle in the _second_ tallest vial cap port
* Vial to Vial = 3" needle in the lowest port
* Inducer = 4" needle in the tallest port or 2" needle in the second lowest

{% hint style="info" %}
To have high accuracy when using the low volume pumps it is important to avoid individual drops. Therefore we want needles to abut inside of the vials to get a constant stream of fluid when pumping.

## custom\_script.py

Copy the ePACE template under `/dpu/experiment/epace-template/`

### "USER DEFINED GENERAL SETTINGS"

1. Most likely you should not need to alter any settings in this section, other than `EVOLVER_PORT`
2. Use the [`"hybrid"` function](./#experimental-overview)
3. Collapse or ignore `growth_curve`, `turbidostat`, and `chemostat` functions

### Alter settings in the `hybrid` function=

`vial 0` is the host cell reservoir

* It is a turbidostat _and_ a chemostat. Read why [here](./#experimental-overview).
* We are setting OD for `vial 0`

#### `start_time`&#x20;

chemostats will not pump until this amount of hours has elapsed

#### `rate_config`

1. Default format: `rate_config = [reservoir, lagoon]`
2. In vial volumes per hour (V/h)
3. Reservoir
   1. Set to greater than the volume you are taking out
   2. Do not set too high or your cells will be unable to grow fast enough and wash out
   3. Turbidostat controls will separately preventing reservoir from increasing in OD too much&#x20;
4. Lagoon - set based off of phage replication rate
5. For example:
   1. If you have a 30mL reservoir and 10mL lagoon
   2. Setting to `rate_config = [1, 1]`
      1. 30mL into reservoir and 10mL into lagoon per hour
   3. Setting to `rate_config = [0.4, 1.2]`
      1. If we set lagoon rate to 1.2 V/h, we should not set reservoir rate to lower than 0.4 V/h to avoid draining the reservoir
      2. 1.2 V/h \* 10mL = 12mL/h into lagoon
      3. 0.4 V/h \* 30mL = 12mLh into reservoir

#### Inducer

1. Set `inducer_concentration` to X the final concentration in the lagoon
2. Turn inducer off to start (`inducer_on = False`)
3. Wait for host cells to grow up before starting induction (`inducer_on = True`) and inoculating with phage
