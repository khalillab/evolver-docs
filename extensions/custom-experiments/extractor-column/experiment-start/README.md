# Experiment Start

{% hint style="warning" %}
[Calibrate](../../../../getting-started/calibrations/) your eVOLVER before beginning your experiment
{% endhint %}

When starting an experiment you'll go through the same process as a [normal experiment](broken-reference). Make sure that you have the extractor columns properly set up and that you also include the slow pumps lines in your line sterilization process.

{% hint style="info" %}
Preemptively check the troubleshooting [page](broken-reference) to see common mistakes before running the experiment
{% endhint %}
