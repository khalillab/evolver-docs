# Extractor Column

## Overview

The two column extractor is a type of eVOLVER experiment designed to continuously extract a molecule of interest exuded by a microbe. One set of vials are bioreactors where cells are continuously cultured. Those vials are each paired with an extractor vial, where microbes are continuous dropped through a solvent layer that extracts a biomolecule of interest. This solvent can be sampled to determine amount of biomolecule that is made.
