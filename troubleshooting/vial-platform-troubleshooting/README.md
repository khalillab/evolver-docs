{% hint style="warning" %}
Before attempting to troubleshoot the vial platform, make sure that the [server](../server-troubleshooting.md) is working as expected.
{% endhint %}

The eVOLVER vial platform is the base that the Smart Sleeves sit upon. It contains the [motherboard](../../hardware/motherboard-layout-and-circuitry/), [Raspberry Pi](../../hardware/raspberry-pi.md) (where the server is running), and power supplies.
