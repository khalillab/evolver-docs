# Upgrade Base eVOLVER Hardware

## Vial Cap Upgrades

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 25/01/15, FynchBio gives the cap that only accommodates needles. This cap does not have a tight seal on the vial and thus does not enable emergency efflux.
{% endhint %}

### Benefits / Options

1. Better seal to vial - enables emergency efflux (see below) away from vial if too much is pumped in
2. More ports available
3. Reusable connectors - can use luer connectors to connect to eVOLVER tubing

See [here](hardware/vial-caps/) for more information and construction protocols.

## Emergency Efflux

Protect your eVOLVER hardware with a sealed vial and additional efflux line dedicated to preventing vial overflows.

Guide [here](guides/emergency-efflux.md).

## Stronger Stirring

More stirring leads to better aeration and thus better growth in some cases. Try this stir bar for more vigorous stirring: [Length 20 mm, Diameter 3 mm (# SBM-2003-MIC)](https://www.stirbars.com/list.php?category=Stir%20Bars\&subCat=Micro%20PTFE\&sessionID=eel7i7mvvdo1r965d2dp0e6le0).

Try different stir speeds to see if you can get stable and intense stirring.

## Bubbling

Many organisms require additional gas exchange outside of what eVOLVER stirring can provide. Others require custom gas mixes for growth. In-vial bubblers provide this.
